The thing is, I've formed an emotional attachment to rudy (my laptop's nickname), and I don't wanna get rid of my little soldier.\r\n\r\nRudy is a lenovo ideapad 710s. He's a 13 inch grower with an i7 6th gen, 8gb ddr4 ram (soldered on, no upgrades), 256gb nvme ssd upgradeable, and a cpu with nice new thermal paste. The laptop's condition is good, since i've basically fixed every issue it's had like replacing hinges, screen and speaker. Webcam, mic, trackpad, keyboard, usb ports, other connections and everything important still work like a charm. The battery is old and needs replacing but that'll cost me only 40 bucks and i'll get 8 hrs of battery life. Hell, even the design is still holding up great, with super thin bezels and a sleek and thin design. Mf can fit into anything.\r\n\r\nSure the specs dont sound the best, and I could be better off laying rudy to rest, but there's more to this laptop. I've had this bad boy since grade 6, and it has served me faithfully ever since. It taught me more than i'd ever learn. and I feel like i'd be betraying rudy if I replaced it when the going got tough. It's exactly like when griffith ascended into a god, leaving guts and the band of the hawks behind. I can't turn into a griffith.\r\n\r\nPlus I feel like the thousands of $ spent on a new laptop could be better spent on something nicer, like a cool lil car or a bike, instead of a foldable computer that'll over heat whenever you push the thing to its limits.\r\n\r\nSo, is rudy good enough to do comp sci work at uoft? Or do I have to say goodbye to an old friend and retire him.\r\n\r\nThanks!", "user": 8, "title": "Can I continue using my 6 yr old laptop for the UofT comp sci course?", "last_active": "2023-04-25T05:41:57.219Z"}}, {"model": "forum.topic", "pk": 3, "fields": {"text": "Should I join the First-Year Foundations Ones Program?
